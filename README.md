# WaveOscillator

I dedicate this project to explore the possibilities and opportunities provided by the Web Audio API. For now, keeping it simple with a wave oscillator, to fundamentally understand patching, nodes and all the basics.
My work is not based on any specific tutorial or article. I aim to solve the challenges in my own ways, but I'm always open to learn about new approaches to a particular problem. If you have something helpful, feel free to share it with me or contribute.

## Usage & Demo

For best experience, use headphones or speakers.

## TODO
